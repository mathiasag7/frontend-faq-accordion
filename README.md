## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

How to declare a font face in scss

```scss
.ff {
    font-family: $font;
    src: url($url);
    font-weight: $value;
    font-style: normal;
}
```

```js
Array.from()
```

Although I ended up not using this section.

### Continued development

Flexbox and CSS Grid to talk about CSS and some of JS as well.

### Useful resources

- [Valeurs et unit√©s CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units) - This helped me to understand more about CSS values and units.
